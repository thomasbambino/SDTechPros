I can see the issue with your navigation bars. Let's unify them to create a consistent experience across your SD Tech Pros client portal.

The problem is that you have two separate navbar components:
1. `NavBar` in `client/src/components/nav-bar.tsx` (used on the homepage)
2. `Navbar` in `client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx` (used on other pages)

Your App.tsx is conditionally showing the second navbar only when a user is logged in, while the homepage independently renders its own navbar.

Here's how we can fix this issue:

Based on my analysis, I've created a solution to fix your navbar issues with the SD Tech Pros client portal. Here's what I found and how I've addressed it:

## Problem Analysis

You have two separate navbar components:
1. `NavBar` in `client/src/components/nav-bar.tsx` (used on the homepage)
2. `Navbar` in `client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx` (used in other pages)

The key differences between these components include:
- Different HTML tags (`<header>` vs `<nav>`)
- Different logo sizing approaches (dynamic vs fixed height)
- The homepage navbar handles both logged-in and logged-out states
- The layout navbar only handles logged-in states
- The App.tsx only shows the layout navbar when a user is logged in

This inconsistency is causing the duplicate navbars when navigating through the application.

## Solution

I've created four artifacts to fix this issue:

1. **Unified NavBar Component** - A new component that combines the best features of both navbars:
   - Uses the `<header>` tag for semantic correctness
   - Maintains dynamic logo sizing using `branding.logoSize`
   - Properly handles both authenticated and non-authenticated states
   - Supports all the features from both previous navbars

2. **Updated App.tsx** - Changes to the main application file:
   - Imports the new unified navbar component
   - Always displays the navbar (not conditionally)
   - Maintains the rest of the routing functionality

3. **Updated HomePage** - Changes to the homepage:
   - Removes the import and rendering of the old navbar
   - Keeps all other homepage content intact

4. **Branding Context** - A new context provider:
   - Centralizes branding settings throughout the app
   - Applies branding colors, logo sizes, and other settings consistently
   - Updates document title and favicon based on branding settings

## Implementation Instructions

1. First, create a new file at `client/src/components/unified-navbar.tsx` with the content from the "Unified NavBar Component" artifact.

2. Create a new file at `client/src/hooks/use-branding.tsx` with the content from the "Branding Context" artifact.

3. Update `client/src/App.tsx` with the content from the "Updated App.tsx with BrandingProvider" artifact.

4. Update `client/src/pages/home-page.tsx` with the content from the "Updated HomePage.tsx" artifact.

After these changes, you'll have a consistent navigation experience throughout the application with:
- A single, unified navbar
- Proper logo sizing based on your branding settings
- Correct display for both logged-in and logged-out users
- No duplicate navbars

The changes also add a branding context that makes it easier to apply branding settings consistently across the entire application, including setting the document title, favicon, and custom colors automatically.
